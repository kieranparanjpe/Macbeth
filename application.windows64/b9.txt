Macbeth/Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight? Or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable as this which now I draw. Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going, and such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses ,or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before. There’s no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.
Macbeth/Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout, and take the present horror from the time, which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 
Narrator/A bell rings.
Macbeth/The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell. 
Narrator/A creak of the floorboards awakes Duncan during his sleep. A shadowed figure looms over him.
Duncan/Aaaarggghhh! Murder!
Narrator/A drowsy Malcolm tackles Macbeth to the ground, stabbing a knife into his midriff. Macbeth is convicted of treason and hanged for his crimes.
