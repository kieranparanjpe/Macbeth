Narrator/Twilight sets upon Scotland as Macbeth journeys home from a perilous victory over Macdonwald and the Norwegians. A weird lady catches his eye. 
Witches/A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.
Macbeth/Speak, if you can: what are you?
Witches/All Hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis! All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!
