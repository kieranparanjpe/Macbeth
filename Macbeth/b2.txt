Narrator/Macbeth sees through the treachery of the weird sisters and dismisses them as common fodder. He rides to meet Duncan, intercepting Ross on the way.
Ross/He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor.
Narrator/Macbeth continues his journey to meet Duncan, satisfied with his new title. 
Duncan/From hence to Inverness, and bind us further to you.
Narrator/The three witches appear in front of Lady Macbeth as prepares for the visit.
Witches/Hail Lady of Glamis! All hail, the Lady! Hail to thee, Lady of Cawdor! All hail, that shalt be queen hereafter!
Lady Macbeth/What is this prophecy you name? Macbeth becometh king?
Narrator/The three witches vanish into the air, as breath into the wind.
Lady Macbeth (to herself)/Duncan, king of Scotland! That is a step on which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, for in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. 
Narrator/Enthralled by the prophecy, Lady Macbeth schemes to murder Duncan in his sleep, unbenknownst to her husband. In his sleep, she slides a blade into its rightful place. The blade lays dormant in a newly formed crevice in Duncanâ€™s gullet.
