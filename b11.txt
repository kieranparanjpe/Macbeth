Macbeth/But alas, Banquo is an honourable man and a worthy friend. I cannot allow my paranoia to get the better of me. 
Narrator/Macbeth dismisses the murderers from his doorstep, informing them of his newfound perspective. Banquo remains unscathed on his horseback ride. 
Banquo/Oh dear Fleance what shall be done about Macbeth. I fear he played’st most foully for the throne. And now something must be done!
Narrator/Banquo rides briskly back to Macbeth’s castle, his suspicions festering. Upon his arrival, he took his rightful seat at the banquet. 
Banquo/MACBETH!
Banquo/Thou hads’t ruled long enough! Three weird sisters promised fortunes of great prosperity, but at what cost. Lies and deceit lead you here. Your hands are a crimson red! I must take you in battle. 
(Narrator): The lords form a circle around Macbeth and Banquo. The two duel. Banquo lunges, planting a blade deep inside Macbeth's left kidney, and again severing his left from his right. Macbeth dies a dishonourable death.
