(narrator): Macbeth prepares and his men prepare for war and fortify their defenses.

(Macbeth): What is that noise?

(Seyton): It is the cry of women, my good lord. The queen, my lord, is dead.

(Macbeth): She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word.

Malcolm/Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down, and show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle, shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we shall take upon ’s what else remains to do, according to our order.

Narrator/The English lay siege to Dunsinane. Macduff races at Macbeth’s heels in the wake of Young Siwards death.

Macduff/Turn, hellhound, turn!

Narrator/Macbeth turns to face Macduff to duel. In one fell swoop Macduff viciously decapitates Macbeth. Malcolm is crowned King and Macbeth is remembered as a tyrant. 

Macduff/ Hail, king! For so thou art. Behold where stands the usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free. I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl, that speak my salutation in their minds, whose voices I desire aloud with mine. Hail, King of Scotland!

Malcolm/ We shall not spend a large expense of time before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland in such an honor named. What’s more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time, As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny, Producing forth the cruel ministers of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen, Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life; this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. So, thanks to all at once and to each one, whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
