(narrator): Macbeth prepares and his men prepare for war and fortify their defenses.

(Macbeth): What is that noise?

(Seyton): It is the cry of women, my good lord. The queen, my lord, is dead.

(Macbeth): She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word.

Malcolm/Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down, and show like those you are. You, worthy uncle, shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we shall take upon ’s what else remains to do, according to our order.

Narrator/The English lay siege to Dunsinane. Macduff races at Macbeth’s heels in the wake of Young Siwards death. 

Macduff/Turn, hellhound, turn!

Narrator/Macbeth turns to face Macduff to duel. In one fell swoop Macbeth viciously decapitates Macduff. Disheartened, the English flee Dunsinane to whence they came. Macbeth remains King of Scotland, but he is forever plagued by the crimes he committed to achieve power.
